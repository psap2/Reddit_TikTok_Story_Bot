# Reddit-and-YouTube-Bot

Objective: Leverage the top 10 Reddit stories both historically and weekly to create engaging content on TikTok. This form of content is then paired up with some non-copyright YouTube videos or forms of visually engaging content that wrap audiences up and drive up engagement and views for TikTok which can be formed into a passive stream of income.

Shortcomings: However, I quickly realized there is a shortage of stories in Reddit that will create engaging content on TikTok. So, then I started tiktok webscrapping and used APIFY, an api platform to collect recent trending tiktok vidoes that could be then used with audio to text platform to make my own videos and stories using a model that then changes those stories into something similar but also unique. Which can then be later posted again as a form of recycling content.
